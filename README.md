That repo contains all my configurations scripts and files for development machine.

```
.
├── scripts/        # Available scripts
├── private/        # Things like ssh keys only local [see: scripts/apply_private]
├── symlinks/       # Files that will be used with symlink [see: scripts/apply_symlinks]
├── .aliases        # Bash aliases
├── .bash_profile   # Bash profile
├── .bashrc         # Bash rc
├── .exports        # Everything will be exported as env variables
```
